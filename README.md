## Overview

This project is a comprehensive data analytics initiative aimed at investigating employee attrition trends in a company. By analyzing key factors such as age, gender, and department, the project identifies patterns that can inform HR strategies and improve employee retention.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Examine employee attrition rates and factors affecting them.
- Provide actionable insights that can help HR teams in making informed decisions.
- Use data visualization to highlight key trends and correlations between employee attributes and their likelihood of leaving the company.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (for analysis and visualization)
- **Data**: IBM HR Employee Attrition Dataset

## Key Insights

- **Attrition Rate**: The overall attrition rate is 16.12%, with employees who left the company represented by a 'Yes' in the 'Attrition' column.
- **Age Distribution**: A significant portion of employees fall within the age range of 30-40 years, with a notable increase in attrition around age 30.
